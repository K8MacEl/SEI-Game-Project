Jeep-Mory Memory Game

This is a fun play on the classic memory card game where the user will get to see pictures of classic Filipino Jeepneys. The user will be challenged to find the matching card for each picture by flipping over the cards and when a match is made the pair will be frozen, facing up, as the user continues to attempt to find the remaining matches. 

The blue square at the top "Matches Made" will populate the number of matches as the game is played/

The yellow sqauare at the top "Guesses Made" will count the number of guesses made, for every two cards flipped this will increase by one.

The red square at the top will allow the user to reset the game at any given time.

Levels of Difficutly:

An added feature to this game allows the user to select how many pairs they want to try to match based on the level of difficulty. They can pick the easy level which is six pairs which will load the board with twelve cards of six pairs. They can pick the medium level which is nine pairs and eighteen cards in total. Or they can pick difficult which is twelve pairs and twenty-four cards in total. If the user does not make a selection and also when the game initially loads, the board defaults to the medium level.  

Once the user had macthed all the cards a yellow box will appear congratulating the user on matching all the jeepneys. The user can either select the X or click anywhere on the window to close out of the yellow window.
