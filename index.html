                <p><br>The most common means of public transportation in the Philippines is the Jeepney. Jeepneys are a
                    symbol of Filipino culture and throughout the country you can ride in decorated Jeepneys of all
                    styles and designs. Play Jeep-Mory to practice your memorization skills while seeing some of
                    the amazing Jeepneys of the Philippine Islands! </p>

            <div class="play"> <strong><br>To Play: </strong>Below the cards are face
                down. Use the EASY, MEDIUM, and DIFFICULT buttons to adjust the number of cards played. Use your mouse to one select card and when you click on the card it will turn over, then select a
                second card which will also turn over. If the two selected cards are a match it will freeze face up, if
                its not a match it will automatically flip back over. The game will continue until all the matching sets
                until all jeepneys are paired.</div>
